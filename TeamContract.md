# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Which platform will you use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project? (Examples: Text message, Discord, WeChat, etc.)
*     Discord

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time?
*     Teammates should respond within 6 hours during weekdays. 

* What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)
*     Teammates should notify each other if they won't be able to meet deadline, or attend tutorials/lectures/ will be late to tutorials or lectures.

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)
*     Listening to everyone's ideas, taking critiques from team members regarding code implementation, design, etc. and changing accordingly.

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
    - some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.
      (In no particular order)
      1) If an issue is google-able/ chatGPT-able, team members should try solving it on their own before reaching out to other team members (for efficiency).
      2) If you have an issue and you have no clue how to fix it, ask team members so that it doesn't get out of hand/ is last minute.
      3) Add (short) comments in code describing intentions for each function, class, etc.
      4) Do not copy paste code from chatGPT, etc. Only use Ai-generated code if you understand what it's doing and are fully sure it integrates with existing code.

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)
*     **majority vote**

---
## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)
*     **Team will resolve conflicts by discussing each side of the argument and being considerate of other team members' opinions.**

---

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)
*     1) Completing their share of work by set deadlines (whether that requires asking team members for help, spending extra time debugging, etc.)
*     2) Attending tutorials and lecture (if unable, messaging team about tardy/absence)
*     3) contributing to team discussions regarding design, ideas, implementation, etc.
